# P5 JS animations

A dump of all the animations that I made using the p5.js library. Inspiration for the animations by [Project JDM on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/@project_jdm)

## Running online
To run online, copy-paste all the text contained in the `script.js` file in each folder into [this site.](https://editor.p5js.org/).

## Running offline
To run locally, you require a local server. There are two alternatives for this. However, firstly you must install p5.js, which comes in a zip file. Download it [here.](https://p5js.org/download/) Extract the files just outside the directories of the folders of the animations.

1. Navigate to the folder, and run `python -m http.server` in the terminal. You can pass another argument to run the server on a specified port. For example, `python -m http.server 8001` runs the server on port 8001.

2. Use the Live Server extension of Vscode. 

Constants have all been declared near the beginning of each of the animations, so their values can be changed to observe the effects on the animation.
